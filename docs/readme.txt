		- What is this?

This is an RPG I've been working on for a little while now... Basicly it (will) include the following features:

  NPC Charactors
  Quest System
  Battle System
  PVP Battle System
  NPC Dialogue System
  Inventory
  Weapons
  Magic System

		- How do I use it?

Right now it's not really ready for prime time as it's still in the alpha (development)
stage, but eventually you'll be able to setup your own game and optionaly have it report
to a master server where your game will be listed.

		- Am I going to be able to control the game?

Yes. I have plans to make an "editor" type system where you will be able to create your
own world, make quests, add objects, houses, and any other feature thats in the game.

		- Controls

To move around use eaither the navigational compass and icons or the following keys:

   ? Movement ?
W	-	UP
A	-	LEFT
S	-	DOWN
D	-	RIGHT

		- I want to help!

At the moment I need:

Sprite Designers 	-	Origonal sprites, or at least uncopyrighted!
PHP Scripters		-	You'll need to be pretty good :-P
